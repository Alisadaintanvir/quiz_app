# Quiz App
This is a simple quiz application that presents 10 true or false questions to the user. The user can select either "True" or "False" as the answer for each question.

## Usage
#### Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/Alisadaintanvir/quiz_app/)

#### Navigate to the project directory: cd quiz-app

#### Run the quiz app: python quiz_app.py

## Questions
The quiz questions and their correct answers are stored in the data.py file. Each question is represented by an instance of the Question class defined in question_model.py.

## Quiz Brain
The QuizBrain class in quiz_brain.py is responsible for managing the quiz flow. It retrieves questions from the question bank, keeps track of the user's score, and determines when the quiz is completed.

## Results
Upon completion of the quiz, the app will display the user's final score out of the total number of questions.
